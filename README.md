# TS20-Thoughts

A game where you can only make people think.

In Thoughts, you are a God that can play with the needs of their humanoids to shape relationships, life goals, ... in addition of shaping the world around them.

All of it happens in a gamified simulation of ecosystems that follow Maslow's pyramid of needs.

The game is still a work in progress, and has been for some time. It advances very slowly, but it is still under my radar.
